# ML-Course_Repository
This repository contains the two final Jupyter Notebooks for the Coding Assignment of the course "Machine Learning" at the University of St. Gallen. 

The members of the team "Failing to Success" were:
Olivier Zehnder (SVM)
Jeremie Schnorf (SVM)
Paul Stephan (ANN&CNN)
David Montani (ANN&CNN)

Our task was to try and build two models which could classify the pictures from the MNIST Fashion Dataset from Zalando into it's ten different categories. The first model was a Support-Vector Machine built by Olivier Zehnder and Jeremie Schnorf. The second model was a Convolutional Neural Network built by Paul Stephan and David Montani. Overall, we managed to achieve an accuracy of 87% using the SVM and 91% using the CNN (presentation slides). 

Both notebooks were written in Google Colab.
